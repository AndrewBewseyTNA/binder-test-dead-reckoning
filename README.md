# Dead reckoning mapping

## Overview

This is a jupyter notebook that shows the course navigated when using dead reckoning. Following the first cell, a there is a re-runnable cell that asks the user for speed bearing and time. The notebook then plots the course taken.

## Units

Currently, the units are presumed to be in meters, degrees, and hours. This is not fixed and some courses may be displayed incrrectly - this is just a test repo. 

## Note

Note that this is a breif notebook working as a pseudo hello-world - this code may be useful on its own further in the project; its currently working as a way to test Binder. If it becomes more sueful, the name will be changed to reflect that.
